# My_Shell_Pipe
Shell Program - Pipe Simulation
This is a simple shell program that also incorporates a pipe simulation. 
If a user enters a "|", then the program will use the output of the shell command
before the "|" as the input of the shell command after the "|".
If a "|" is not entered, then the program runs the shell command that was entered.
